# Cluedo
<p>Program that simulates the board game cluedo.</p>

<p>I got sick of losing in cluedo and decided to make this program so I can practice and hopefully start winning.
Plus it's a perfect project to improve my object oriented programming skills so hey, there's that.</p>

TODO:
<ul>
  <li>Build a GUI so I don't have to use pen and paper to figure out things</li>
  <li>AI players?? Online players?? Ambitious but could be cool</li>

</ul>
